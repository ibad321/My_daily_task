# My Daily Task (with Clean Architecture)



### Packages we are using:


[flutter_bloc :](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc)  Widgets that make it easy to integrate blocs and cubits into [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). Built to work with [package:bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc). The Bloc library provides very good ðŸ¦„ tooling and compared to other state management solutions that use Streams, it's a pure gem.

[get_it :](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) This is a simple **Service Locator** for Dart and Flutter projects with some additional goodies highly inspired by [Splat](https://github.com/reactiveui/splat). It can be used instead of `InheritedWidget` or `Provider` to access objects e.g. from your UI.

[equatable:](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable) Being able to compare objects in `Dart` often involves having to override the `==` operator as well as `hashCode`.

fluttertoast :- [Link:](https://pub.dev/packages/fluttertoast)

sembast:- [Link:](https://pub.dev/packages/sembast) Yet another NoSQL persistent store database solution for single process io applications.

animated_bottom_navigation_bar:- [Link:](https://pub.dev/packages/animated_bottom_navigation_bar)

intl:- [Link:](https://pub.dev/packages/intl)

flutter_slidable:- [Link:](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_slidable)

path_provider:- [Link:](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider)

awesome_dialog:- [Link:](https://pub.dev/packages/awesome_dialog)

flutter_local_notifications:- [Link:](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications)

path_provider:- [Link:](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider)
